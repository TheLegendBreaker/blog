					<h2> about hector</h2>
					<p>
						my thanks for stopping by!
						<br>
						<br>
						this is more than just a place to share my life. i hope what i share bulsteris my self-esteem. my internet presence is mainly bullying racists, qanon, maga-maggots, and the like. while it's great fun and they deserve everything coming to them, my self image has suffered. embarrassment washes over me when i think about how i must look. 
						<br>
						<br>
						to prove to myslef i can do more than viciously ridicule dingleberries i made this blog. i hope you like. as much as sharing may help with how i think others think of me, i share for myself. while i am convinced i look like an asshole, no amount speculating about other peoples' ideas of	me will change that i made those thoughts.
