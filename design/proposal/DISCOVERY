# TSK proposal
## DESIGN
The biggest goal is to give share holders an easy overview of what TSK does.

We help our community grow by making economic opportunities out of locally grown food. 

TSK is a cafe with two locations and community learning space in downtown Abq. We trun food into economic opportunities for our community.  

- More specific link labels:  Home, Cafes, shop, Food business training, community classes, APS classes, Cooking for Generations, Values, Supporet.
- Or:  Home, Cafes, shop, Our Courses, APS classes, Values, Supporet.
- make mock ups look like the "Our Nutritional Values" campagion
- Add a vendors button to footer nav for order bluk
- Correct the featured card links on the home page

The problem:

It's difficult to efficently tell what TSK does becuse it does so many varied things. 

The solution:

Organize the website linding page into small easy to understand blocks that provide an over view of a specific TSK does and a link to more information about that thing. 

## MOCK UP

Like the same top down view as the our values, but of a farmer's market getting ready.
